# Covid19-Data-Analysis
# Overview
This project involves the time series analysis of COVID-19 cases using Python. The goal is to analyze the temporal trends, patterns, and dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic through the examination of daily or cumulative case counts, deaths, recoveries, and other relevant metrics.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis contains COVID-19 statistics, including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, reported on a daily basis for different regions or countries.

# Analysis Steps
Data Acquisition: Obtain the COVID-19 dataset from reliable sources such as government health departments or public repositories like Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Data Repository.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, including handling missing values, formatting dates, and aggregating data at appropriate levels (e.g., country-level or regional-level).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the time series data to understand trends, seasonality, and any anomalies. Explore correlations between variables and identify patterns in the data.

Time Series Modeling: Apply time series forecasting models such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average), SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA), or Prophet to predict future COVID-19 case counts or analyze the impact of interventions.

Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the forecasting models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Visualization and Interpretation: Visualize the forecasted values alongside actual data to assess the model's accuracy. Interpret the findings to gain insights into the trajectory of the pandemic and potential factors influencing its spread.
